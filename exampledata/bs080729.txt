I'm nothing special, in fact, I'm a bit of a bore.
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before.
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out of love
So I say thank you for the music
But sometimes we'll sing it
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it?
I ask you, Lord of St.
What will I be?
Without a song or a lens?
What are we?
So I say, thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could know
Mmm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've opened wonder, how did it all start?
We found that that nothing can catch your heart like a memory came
Well, the way it was, I'm a fan
So I say thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Look and live without it
I ask in all honesty
What could I be without a song
I've been so lucky, I'm the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing and have a true every breathe of it
What a joy, what life, what a chance
Thank you for the music that's sometimes singing
Thanks for all the joy that bring it
Look and live without it
I ask him all of his tea
What will I be without a song or a dance when I win?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me.
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me.
Well, I'd love to cheer if I hadn't heard 40 tons of steel If I don't find my baby
that I guess I never will. I've been a long lost soul for a long, long time. I've been around
everybody up to know what's on my mind. You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I.
Well, I'm the kind of guy that likes to make a living running round
And I don't need a stranger to tell me that my baby's let me down
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I
Well, a luxury liner, forty tons of steel, and no one in this whole wide world can change
the way I feel, I've been a long lost soul, for a long, long time.
I've been around
Everybody ought to know it's all my mind
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I
Well, I'm the kind that I could like
And I don't need a stranger to tell me that my babies let me down
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I
Do I?
Well, there's sex in the sunny day
The shine's down on Boyz's Street
And I love the USA
So share the modern world with me
Cause I've been learning things you understand
I've been loving the modern world now
Put down this cigarette
You drop out of B.U.
All right.
That's right.
Well, out in the afternoons,
out in the airplane,
we'll share a part in love
under suburban rain.
And in all you think we're saying now
I'd be in love with the bottom world now
But down the cigarette
And I'd like a true girl, uh
Well, out on a rude line
But you can nearly die
Stop all this weak stuff
And drop out of a video
If we know you'd see what they do
If we know the blood is over now
But now we should run
And drop out of high school
All right
Oh, that's right
That's right.
Well, I've been loving to see what I've said now
I've been loving to love what I've said now
But don't you have to have like a true girl
Well, listen
Well, the modern world is not so bad
And I'd like a student to say
In fact, I'd been to heaven
If you'd share the modern world with me
We've been learning things better
We've been learning from other people now
Put down the singer and share the modern world with me
I can hold, hold out some doubt But with these ice caps melting down
With the trams, it's the sound And my Chevrolet tail blade going round and round and round
Come a little camera, stand under the hood of a king
Your brain's a boy like a refugee from a house that's burning
And the heat blips kind of rain
She's got an attack just crowned
With a dot, dot, dot on the ground
And she's a beast inside a cloud
We're with the cowboys chugging around
We're aiming like a camera ray
Standing in the heart of the cave
We're pulling our phones
This is what's that kind and I'm not willing to go
I want to know when I've lost the day
Oh
Come on
Anybody is born and you can wrap your chains on the house and pray
And the back what is calling the name

Yes, mm-hmm.
With no kind of intimidation or any kind of like weird

Gotta put me through the ringer as if I'm
You know the best actor it going now is Shia LaBeouf and then spying on you behind of him
Like I've got to run the gauntlet to prove to spike how good Shilah Boof is, I don't care.
Who cares?
I never heard of him.
Might I recommend go to Netflix and get the Battle of Shaker Heights.
Then you will fall in love with him the way the rest of us did.
I remember waiting online to see that movie and the disappointment when the
theater manager came down the line counting people and then finally said
sir this is you right now can come to the next show you will be the first
person allowed into the next show and I begged I said well Sydney aisle please
let me sit in the aisle it's sir there's a fire hazard to have that many
people in the theater. Can I watch through the little window then from outside the
door? Soundless. Can I get a soundless screening of the Battle of Shaker Heights?
No, no, no! You're first. That was resigned. Resigned to that. The brother here might get there.
Everybody's here. Mike. Me. Did I mention Mike? No. Is this it? Oh, Jeepers, creepers.
We go right to the celebrity line now, throwing it over. Is this the, I picked up on the celebrity line, Mike.
Okay. Hello, WFMU, you're on the air. Hey Tom, it's Jason and Paul from Human
Giant. What?
Jason Wallener, Paul's year. Slow it then. Come on. Jason Wallener.
Yes. And Paul Sheer. Yes. From the human giant. Yes. I'm not on the show. But you
are you are behind the scenes. You're like the director. Yes. And a writer.
That's correct. I'm a producer and a producer and and the editor and the editor and you do a lot of the graphic design, too
That's also true. That's right. So Jason Walliner first of all, why am I saying Jason Walliner and Paul Shear?
Gonna reverse that Paul Shear and Jason Walliner
No, it's got a text from Julie Klaasner
there. Okay. Any other names we can, uh,
age man. Let's a little slowdown on the age man. So that's,
we're building to that. So we're at Comic Con. Yes. Well, let me just say,
I say thank you for both coming on the, on the, on the radio. It's exciting.
We have Paul Scheer is one of the guys in front of the camera on the human
giant. Yes. And you may have also seen him example, for example, on 30 rock.
Indeed and yeah, that's the things I do and on black bald
Bet the best is the best week ever the best week ever. That's right
black bald as Jason said I think Jason was
What are you taking a shot at?
Okay, so so you might have seen him in a bunch of different things and then Jason Walner who who his his life is a whole
long tail which we will get into another time but it started off as a child actor
and now and a movie uh... we can a bernie yes in weekend at bernie's he is the
kid who uh...
who uh... gets uh... uh... offensive he like berry's bernie in the sand and
then like uh... shoot some uh... the bird
in a very creative way to it involved like flickering of the hand it was very
yeah fire to gun at uh...
Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy, but I couldn't pull the trigger by my
hand wasn't strong enough so they had another kid play them and see the hand
for that shot. Really? So you literally could not like muster the strength. How
old were you at that point? I was seven years old. A seven-year-old Jason
Walliner. Couldn't fire a gun. On the beach. Where did that movie shoot? I believe
Wilmington, North Carolina. Wilmington, North Carolina, a 17-year-old, not a
seventeen-year-old
a seven-year-old
unless you're like uh...
webster
uh...
twenty-four years old did you have any like experiences with Andrew McCarthy
on that movie
he was very nice
nice guy
nice guy good guy
job the silverman
not so much
now there was very kind about terry uh...
was the name again terry bellea
uh... terry kizer terry kizer
terry kizer still trying to get the new weekend at bernie
I'm trying to direct that one. That would be great. If you went full circle with it be coming home
Exactly Bernie's back
Soviet story wouldn't it be a skeleton at this point though?
From what I understand this is that this is not a bit
This is totally true
Terry Kaiser has pitched a movie where Bernie have a twin brother and that Bernie died
And they were both named Bernie. I
Don't like that. I don't like that move. I'm not I'm not gonna green light that movie
in the fact that you actually have played some footage of it at the new
comic on this weekend
that i have to the panel
so we are joined by these two guys paul shear and jason walliner
who were uh... very exciting uh... they were at the uh... comic con
in san diego
this past uh... weekend
it's it's been an insane weekend we have experienced a lot of things a bunch of
people to comic on convention
a full-on robbery and an earthquake
all within four days
now who did you rob
that
that we are appear may be the guy who bought it
we took his gun belt
so you actually by ten unfortunately you were robbed
yes we we were writing in this place in ocean side california
and uh... when we checked into this uh... house the woman's like i don't have the
key
but you don't have to worry because the area is really safe totally safe
And we went, there's a pool and a hot tub outside.
And we went the first night, just kind of hang out in the hot tub.
Like four guy friends, hanging out.
And I took my glasses off because of the steam.
And I kept thinking that I saw something moving inside the house.
And so we were just talking about how it was the strangers,
and we were going to get strangers.
And then we went back inside.
And there was a fan and a light on that had not been on.
And we realized now that we're pretty sure someone
with inside the house
either robbing it or casing it
and left when they saw
um... for really strong looking guys in the hot tub and who were these four
strong guys were they in the
adjoining hot tub
it was that i actually believe that they saw from the hot tub and go great
we can totally route that
this is not there's no threat
we can take these four
so you know what no one would see the reason why we
uh... like thought someone was in the house is because
a fan was on and a light was on
and we thought that like and there's also someone placed a copy of
the dvd of mister majorium magic and pour him on
uh... rob hubel who's also star human giant on his bed but that was me i
actually did that and so everybody just assume the same person to turn on the
lights in the fan
scare us
was person put the mister majorium magic and pour him on the bed
now that just fell out of nowhere or did you actually do that jason
i know they they left a bunch of dvd and have the homeowners we thought it
was we thought it was like a beach house that no one lived in
because it was ridiculously over decorated in a way that no one could
ever
live among like they basically like bought out a whole home goods and put
everything in this house but it turned out a real family
did live there
uh... but they were that like there was a vase in front of like on the coffee
table in front of the television you can see the dv from
from the couch
So it seemed like they just filled this house with stuff.
But then an actual family turns out
did live there until very recently.
So basically, we come home on Saturday night.
We find all of our stuff is missing.
And the crack police squad of the ocean-side police
come roaring in and get down to business.
And it became kind of like just a comedy of errors.
Like literally, they brought me inside
to identify my missing material and the police officer.
All right, what's missing from this room?
Go, oh, my computer.
And he sees on the floor that there's a Comic-Con bag
where he goes, oh, you went to Comic-Con?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I went to Comic-Con.
And he goes, so anyway, the computer's missing.
Was it fun?
Yeah, it was fun.
My computer was gone, and also my, like, yeah,
did you see any Star Trek stuff at Comic-Con?
And I'm like, yeah, no, there wasn't
too much Star Trek stuff there.
Kind of, you know, I just want to give you
the list of my stuff that's missing of myself.
I like Nightwing.
eurover you read night wing
well no i haven't really read night wing he's like all right
and then he'd be grudgingly wrote down
certain things that i was missing
doesn't like night wing
but that's where it's down
so so as though and everybody got what their computers taken
each of us had a mac
uh... laptop
uh... that was still and they also they sold i think my i thought i think
maybe he will die pod
and uh... and then every day just went to the house was full of these
I'm actually most embarrassed because he stole my notebook and I just don't want those bad ideas that are in my notebook to be out.
I don't want anyone to see it. Now I feel accountable for the terrible ideas that are contained in my notebook.
They also stole both Rob and myself had a Gillette Fusion Shaver and a replacement blade.
had a uh... july fusion shaver and a replacement plate they took all those
and the other the other crazy weird thing was that
uh... they'd left to unopened wine bottles by the backdoor entrance and then
to unopened uh... bottles of coca cola
in my by bathroom
and so we were we're trying to figure out what this meant
i i believe that they were kind of trying to make a statement like uh...
uh... the uh... the wet robbers in home alone you know where they would turn
on all the things and flood the houses
these are like you know they were the wet bandits and i thought that he's
got yet we've adjusted to the police they call him the double bottle bandit
said that i think they are impressed with that
cola bandit
that i think these guys
so and and that the house that was so safe when the cops came by for the
oh yeah
this is a shooter's alley over here
we go shooter's alley what what does that mean and he goes
a bunch of guys shooting heroin over here
a lot of fake habits
yeah so they're literally right next door in the alley after they just got
done i guess i'd say it's never and they kept saying we kept saying like we
We don't know if we want to stay here tonight. We really don't feel safe
Like there was because also even though the doors were unlocked
They did bust into the door on the side. That was pretty open and we had thousands of dollars of stuff stolen and they kept saying
No, no, this is a trust. This is a really safe neighborhood
This never happens and I said well this this does happen at least one
Happened to us right now. So so what what did this?
This lady who say to you then after what after like whoops
Well, the lady, for some reason, never wanted to acknowledge the fact that it was a big
deal.
Like, we were afraid to stay here, and she's like, why?
Well, because the night before, there might have been strangers in the house, and then
the next night we were robbed.
Those are the reasons why we want to leave.
We've been here three nights, we've been invaded two of those nights.
And she's like, well, I don't want to give you back your money.
Like, well, all right, so we kind of take that,
and then, oh, so she's gone for a couple hours.
And I just hit the following night.
So we sleep the next day, and we come,
and we go after her, we come home,
and we're thinking, should we stay?
Should we go somewhere else?
Do we feel, OK, here?
Do we think we can get anything, any work done or anything?
And then Paul just happens to hit play on an answering
machine in the kitchen.
And it was the most vulgar and threatening message
you could possibly ever imagine from a guy that will live in uh... like tahoe
threatening the owner of the house yes he's threatening the woman won't have
and saying basically
well i've tried to collect my money and it looks like you're not gonna pay so i'm
gonna have to take what i'm owed anyway and in the only way he really said
it was completely like a villain the movie goes the only way i know how he
goes
you got nice furniture maybe i'll take that furniture you got a nice thing
they'll come in your house and take them
and he seemed to have a real vendetta against where they were from he goes
you and all your southern california friends and they got very vulgar about
what they could do
with each other
and he said uh... he goes
this is not the way we do it in california he goes
because this is northern california
this is california
it was insane and so we're flipping out
going like oh my god we cracked a case that you know this is
so we we call the woman to tell her hey we have this crazy man leaving a
message thing he's gonna break into your house and the woman's like
uh... you realize that you're calling me at eleven o'clock at night on a
sunday
but yeah but this is a crazy and leaving a message like
do you realize
she starts screaming at as these and saying this has to stop yet that's the
stop
you're like all this madness
it's all right and so now we've got some more nights
we were broken into the first night we were robbed
of all our stuff the second night the third night we find a voicemail
leaving threats against the house and she thinks we're overreacting
and she said that that's unrelated
and that was a separate incident but clearly
this person has enemies and we left out after that
this is horrifying i'm so sorry all your stuff was taken by the way for people
listening we're joined by jason walliner
and paul sheer of uh... the human giant which uh...
it was an empty v series
which uh...
i guess has had its second season
where can people see it
itunes i'd definitely not on mtv because they do not replay our show
uh... i think we just are there on mtv canada
they understand mtv is not known for uh...
rerunning programming guys
yeah no you you can probably only catch randy jackson america's best
dance crew maybe one
or uh... week maybe one and then they run it
and say
for example
i've been looking for this episode of uh...
while and out
and bruce bruce was on
all bruce bruce is great i've never seen it again
yeah all of the air one
and they never they actually burn the master today
i know i've been doing the same thing when i i want to see that one episode
where nick cannon did the uh...
last temptation of uh...
what is it
uh... i didn't know about uh...
and we're getting the reference the last temptation of dm x and a really
tasteful
really tasteful uh... combination of the last patient of christ and uh... dm x
i want we we killed our version of that sketch after he did it which was
unfortunate
i want to see an episode of wild and out where uh... nikhan and steam doesn't
win
that
there are like the harlem globe trotters of mtv every other team is
like the uh... the with the senators or like a it's like a quick show
styles can't know exactly make it
that guy's always that's always like
guy goes up and does the dumbest thing you've ever seen ever
thing another mike lights up
the other team does something
and
like we know those were they were both terrible
uh... both wildly unfunny
but what why did his
get a pass on that
the thing that is open my mind to that was i had met one of the producers of
that show
and i thought oh yeah you know robin i come from an improv background
And she goes, oh, yeah, she's like, we've been trying to get more into improv.
And I go, oh, wait, isn't the show improvised?
And she's like, no, no, no, we write that, which makes me more suspicious of their
writing process or bombshells dropping on the show tonight.
Yes.
Pretty good.
What else will we find out tonight?
So I'm going to whistle.
So I'm sorry to hear about your, your, all your electronics.
That's terrible.
That's all right.
Well, we'll be all right.
Did you have any fun at the Comic Con?
It was really fun.
I was doing this really dumb thing where, you know, there's all these people in
in costumes going around. There's literally thousands of people in these
really elaborate costumes. And they're famous for the three
days that they're here at Comic-Con, so we've just been taking pictures of them
and just hugging them a little bit too tightly or getting them. Jason would
approach each one of the costume characters from Skeletor to a
transformer to like a Jedi Knight, wrap his arm around their
belly and look up to them and lovingly gaze. It was almost like it was so
sweet and so innocent that the people didn't know how to react negatively to
it because it was incredibly awkward because he would really be rubbing their
tummy and if the person was ever with a female costume character he would
completely ignore them completely ignore them to put his back towards a wonder
woman and hug a Batman and look up at the Batman and in such a nice adoring
way that that ended basically there was like an eight-foot Darth Vader and I
went to try to do that and and he was just covered in sweat and some of his
clothes rubbed off on me and I thought all right I'm done I'm done hugging
I'm gusting stranger you mean his cloak rub like the dye on his thing yeah like
there's a black streak on my arm it was also it was cold sweat too it had been
just hanging out for well cuz he was a voice box gives everything I took it
refrigerated you know he should know that they could buy black capes you
and have to paint a cake black
and i think i'm on my highlight of the festival was uh...
seeing a hour long cling on play called clean-on lifestyles
which was uh...
a bunch of clinton putting on a very dramatic
almost clinton glad to have been going gary glenn roth
style play where it was a bit of a straight drama
about the cling on trying to get back to their home world but in english not
in clinton yeah for some reason
and and where where was that being held out that was in ballroom six a
which is like just a big bar with
with two thousand seats and it's like the best possible place to watch that
who had a performance without microphone without microphone that was the big
the big choice of the evening
so some actors
were projecting other actors were not
um... and yet they and it was a it was a big kind of production jason actually
tried to get pictures taken with one of those clings and he made him wait
and then took out his knife and pose with a knife to uh...
your throat
we have uh... jason walliner and paul shear from uh... human giant on
giving us their
comic-con recap
so so uh...
so you were so that was what you spent your time doing pretty much going
and getting your your picture taken with uh...
guys in in said costumes we would also just hang around the um...
the autograph the whole floor of like these really fed uh... you know you
not that just you know people are in the living but if there's something
fed up a whole place if you think it yet it's basically order of alan
the idea
it's basically a
a big cafeteria but instead of like tables where there would be food it's
just
people from shows
it from the seventies you know and even people from the shows like couple
months ago like of there's a big contingent of
remember that stan lee show who wants to be a superhero yes yes somehow they
were all there
uh... yet they were signing autographs fat mama
uh... who was one of the characters
was signing autograph for twenty dollars
but she was she recognized paul from best week ever and i got a free one
and it and luckily the thief
did not feel that
uh... everything else is replaceable it is like mom autograph it's kind of
heartbreaking for the guy to just came off shows who are there for their first
year with it with the table looking at these guys who've been there for
twenty or thirty years and you mean your entire future map out one of the
other something there was something very odd to like they had linda gray and
She was from the mom and silver spoons or like the girlfriend and silver spoons like she was there signing autographs
And I I wouldn't imagine like these the the hot girlfriend from silver spoons would get a lot of
Table action, but she had a very big line every day. Who was the saddest celebrity you saw which one
Well, you out the most Lou Ferrigno upset me the most because
We were talking to Lou Ferrigno for a second and this one guy came over to Lou and it's like hey Lou
it's so great to see you man can i get a picture and just blue goes twenty
dollars
and he's uh... i think he's he's mostly uh... death right yes and he read
lips um... but i don't even think he looked in that direction i think he
can just sense that
that body language it just it just broke my heart that like this guy was so
excited to see his hero
and it was a without even batting an eye like i'm not excited to see you just
What about this?
That is sad.
Oh, booly.
Could you imagine, like you said about being the first year
you go to that thing, just being like,
so like you're taking the elevator down
like the thing, or you're just like, so what?
And you realize you're next to like,
<E.D.> Patrick in the thing.
He's like, don't worry, this thing's easy.
You just sit there, you sign the stuff on.
They're mostly good people.
There's a couple of creeps, you just blow them off.
anybody gives you too much of a hard time you you wave to one of the security
guy
the two the two that the two saddest moments are
let's take a it's like being picked for tickball or something because
you just see like there's certain tables of a long line and then right next to
it is a person with no line
like the guy who played flash gordon from flash gordon of this and there
no one there and it's like they're trying to look like they're busy doing
something like i thought one person working a crossword but like another
people just like constantly kind of posing like oh yeah i'm
when i'm thinking of i'm thinking of something i'm not you know
well uh... what would be an even worse that was when you would go at the end of
the day and people had to take their own signs down
which is a roll-up
you know they're little fun we would hang out there for a little while until
we would just hit the table and people would start to come over
and be like a human change and then
like a
yeah you guys feel weak we can't be here and then yeah
then you guys are like twenty dollars
twenty dollars
what have you looked in a crystal ball you saw all four of you sitting at a
table
uh... what about this
you look into a crystal ball
you see three of you sitting at a table ten years from now at that thing
and there's one three of you sitting there and one
and
would you rather would you rather be in that and
or be at that table
i would rather be better i would rather be better
oh man but you know i also thought that which was great in the autograph
last station
uh... on day saturday and sunday the convention goes on from thursday to
sunday
by sunday the prices lower dramatically like uh...
uh... like one one person started at forty dollars
and it was a done by fifteen by the time the weekend with over
as if like his value as a human has dropped
it's not like he's got a unload is not like look i don't want to carry this
stuff back home
talking about moving his pan across a piece of paper
how you use
your value with low you're like
yeah like you're not worth
you're not worth forty
at the huge thing to say i'm not worth forty dollars and
i'm worth fifteen you devaluing yourself
the greatest person that was doing this was Richard Dreyfus was there for some
reason we have not at the autograph alley but just uh...
like it's a movie poster stand like in the middle of the convention floor
and uh... it's such a weird place for him to be and he's still like
he's not that type of actor and they and they're just these hand-printed
signs that rigid drivers will be here tomorrow
and the only people believe that they had to run around really try to get the
word out about you know so what is what is he
doing there what is he's signing uh... after all in the book but i feel like he
must have been kept
yeah it's he uh... signing uh...
things from that uh...
that show he had them uh... max uh...
was that so called
he had on uh...
was actually no one
how do you not know the show
yeah i think that
i was going to be krypton dorps tribe
no yeah what's he saying krypton dorps tribe posters you know um... the one
thing that was that about it too like jason saying that no one knew he was
there but i think the reason why no one knew he was there it's because
you ever see like on phone like on telephone polls but like missing dog
white you know
tell you how old you know the dog is and some of that i've never i've seen
uh...
they posted the same thing for richard rifus it was just a white piece of
paper with like black letter and just blow it up to like twenty five
father like richard rifus in person
seven to nine you know this day
it was by the education of max bickford
hahahaha
and i don't remember that so what if people that yet so it
well you know what they'll probably richard rifus probably missing to probably
today there's things all around san diego missing richard rifus
he's in some fans weird close encounters uh...
uh... diorama
signing mashed potatoes
not in his basement yet
find my devil's mountain
bill devil's mountain will find it together
here's a mashed potatoes let me out of here
we we got the best uh... we got the best flam
um... early on as a as human giant like we tried to sneak into one of the
panels
and we figured all right you know maybe we can
we can use some of like the fact that we have a TV show on the kind of sneak
in
to like one of the you know to sneak into the watchman panel
you get to have to wait online at in the
on for like three or four hours like literally the people lined up
at three o'clock in the morning for the watchman panel we thought
you know and look we know we just
we're we're not proud of the fact that we try to take it at the pool rank we
try the ball right where i think you know can we um...
you know can we kinda sneak in here you know uh... uh... you know it's like when
we you know if we wait online we feel like we'll
we'll kind of get mobbed which is you know i feel better saying it now a lot
but uh... and and the guy and the guy looks at the goes
a lot of people get mobbed here
especially our costume characters
and it was what makes you guys different
so we were compared to a guy who dresses up like a transformer we have no rank
over
like david jones from the part of the country before you that's good for you
it was a one of the fact i would have said right this way gentleman
and let you through
then you know what then you would have thought that that was the base level
there
yet and you know then you would be you think you could take a step from that
and see what the next level is comicon is a great equalizer
it everyone
assembling next week
can we get on stage at the watchman uh...
i wanna fit next to melon acriman and answer questions
the watchman movies can be awful by the way
well you know it was really interesting because they did not show any dialogue
from the movie just a lot of images that look like the images from the
the comic book so i think if you achieve that like i think that that he was
basing it all on that like people are excited
i was able to replicate things that you are familiar with but no one spoke
which is just a sign of
maybe things didn't turn out to get how many people really read that comic book
it when it's all said and done
what are they are they hoping everyone who read it is going to come out and buy it
if i take it or in trouble
i like to think you know
it's a thing that's going to be a disaster
i'll predict it right now
watchman i'll tell you what's not going to be a disaster
underworld three we thought panel for underworld three where uh...
we got a very intense discussion about the differences between werewolf
and vampire
the net in any of those movies so that
so the difference is the thing about this movie underworld three is they
couldn't get cake beckons all in
so they had to move it
exactly like a cake beckons on jason clinton for her
or we call her fake beckon
i like it
if you look just like her
it's like a lot like
so real quick
in conclusion highlights
highlights um...
uh... we were robbed by a uh... by a gang of thieves that left two bottles
without front
with the uh... we did not get our money back after the house is rough the
highlight is not getting murdered by the person who's in the house while we're
okay fair enough that actually is a highlight you still are alive
yeah and uh... we got to see a play in clang on
no water
what does uh...
what does two thousand eight hold for the uh...
the human giant
we're figuring out
literally right now
hopefully only more human giant exciting
h.g.t.v
yeah it's going to be a home and garden
do some sketches about plants
well thank you
jason walner
thank you tom thank you paul sheer thank you very much people can

Thank you, Paul Sheer.
Thank you, Jason Wallener.
there. Comic Con. There you go. How was that, Mike? Oh, fine. Okay. Sorry. Is that a C?
Mike gives that segment a C. All right. There we go. Mike doesn't know that stuff. Comic
stuff. He doesn't pay attention. Did you see Batman yet, Mike? Did you like it? I saw it.
I saw it twice. I saw it once by myself and it once with my lady friend.
All those movies are a little long. They can always trim.
They could have trimmed 15 minutes from from Batman. I will say it was better the second time. I
Saw both times and I max both times. Oh
Yeah, you didn't like the the final thing in the movie
I'm telling you see it in IMAX if you can so I go to I go to I go to this IMAX I buy a ticket
Days in advance because it's selling out this thing's selling out left and right in iMacs
So I buy a ticket for the iMac show of
Of Batman, what was the cold against straight up the Batman 2?
The dark knight so I go I get online
Because first of all if you're gonna go see this thing in iMacs
I'm you got to get there early not only it's not good enough to just have the ticket. I
I don't want to be the guy stuck in the bottom the first row left oh very polite
post-interview email I am from a text email I am text text from Paul Shear
see that's a professional thanks for having us on that's a professional that
That guy gets back on again.
Now you watch the bet, well I tracked that thing on iTunes, best show bump.
You watch how it explodes.
Your brother.
So it's not good enough to get a ticket to the thing.
You've got to get there so that, because like I was saying, I don't want to end up in the
front row because there's no seats left.
I'll be looking up at that thing.
It's like watching a movie projected onto the side of a skyscraper with me sitting on
the street right at the base of the building looking up at it.
Then suddenly everything that I'm at stands for is mocking you.
So I get there.
I'm not kidding you one hour early with a ticket.
And I'm standing there.
I'm like 35th online already.
I'm not even first.
I'm already wondering if I'm going to get one of the primo seats.
And I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.
Then all of a sudden I look over after a half hour of waiting online.
What do I see?
I see a child in a blue t-shirt.
Then I see another child in a blue t-shirt.
Then I see another child in a blue t-shirt.
And then I realized, oh no.
There's a camp going to this movie.
Some camp, this is a day trip for a camp.
They're coming to see this thing.
They're gonna ruin it.
Then I looked, there's a hundred kids
in the blue T-shirts.
A hundred kids.
And then the showing before me lets out
and there was like a hundred kids in green T-shirts
come out of there and they were so rowdy.
Said, oh no, this is gonna, I've been waiting for this.
I got the ticket.
I'm ready to see it in our optimum conditions.
Let's take it 16 bucks.
I'm gonna get it ruined by some camp counselor.
Schedule bring these kids down.
First of all, what's sicko running a camp?
Now these kids are like 10 years old, nine years old.
What's sick camp counselors like?
you know let's take him to see a movie
that while at that first of all is PG-13
but is also terrifying
it's full on terror you know what you take them to go see something
where uh... where an outhouse explodes
and then someone throws the f-word around once
that's the kind of PG-13 thing you take them to
you take them to the sting with a guy with the
cut marks on both sides was mouth putting knives in people's mouths
I Was terrified at that thing and the joke is not even the scariest part of that thing
Gary Oldham's accent his Chicago accent is the scariest thing about it
No, actually, I will say that is the best acting Gary Gary Oldham's one of those guys were it's like
Oh, he's one of the all-time best actors and then like he started to add it up
be like, wait, is he? Like, what has he done? Wasn't he realized? He hasn't been kind of
coasting for a while. So to his credit, in Batman, by the way, WFMU, East Orange, WXHD
Man, Hope World Wide and World Wide Web at WFMU.org. This is best shown. WFMU, my name's
Stop sharpling, we are here till 11 o'clock.
Easton Standard Time.
Gary Oldham.
Gary Oldman.
Gary Oldham.
You watch this.
And he's doing the thing.
He's doing it.
He's actually underplaying something for the first time
in his career. Like already, he's playing it as a human being. Because you could picture
the Gary Oldham of a few years ago would be like, these guys are in costumes, but I'm
going to be bigger than all of them. I'm going to be in a costume just with my words
in my performance. The guy lays back, does it right? So then the movies, then we get
into the theater, they usher us in, I run up, I'm telling you, I jumped seats to get
to that section, because all of a sudden, it's now just a foot race to the good seats,
which is just up, middle and up, dead center.
It's a foot race.
And I get stuck behind a yurtle of the turtle going up the aisle.
Oh, how's this work in this iMac thing?
Admittedly, I had a chance to observe the iMac's theater
to its full capacity when I saw Speed Racer by myself.
I saw it was in this exact theater earlier.
and i saw speed racer by myself so i literally moved four times during that
solo showing
getting a feel for where the better seats were in the uh... i max theater
paul tompkins just uh... i am asking if there will be spoilers no spoilers
don't worry
no spoilers
not gonna spoil anything
not gonna spoil anything
spoiler free
first of all
things made three hundred forty million dollars so far
everybody should have seen it by now
mike sawed mike this is the first movie mike saw a year
mike doesn't go to the movies anymore
so then i'm stuck behind your little turtle going down and i literally i
literally climbed a seat because i was like i'm not going to sit here
for two and a half hours
in a bad seat because some slowpoke was moving up the aisle when I was right behind him.
I leapfrogged a couple of seats, boom, got the seat I wanted, sat there, and then I watched
as the kids filed in all those stupid blue T-shirts pouring in.
Thankfully, the camp counselors were keeping them all to the right side of the theater
and yelling at them
yelling at them and then finally
like everyone in a group
everyone in a group
josh sit down
everyone in a group
go to the uh... little boys room
before the movie begins
can you hold my seat
and i set my uh... my magazine down i was reading a uh...
well magazine was a reading new york magazine
so i left it on the seat
the kids that absolutely
and as i'm walking down
the stairs
the camp counselor goes
this is the dumbest thing i've heard in my life
because i was thinking maybe i'll stop i'll get a snack also
Maybe we'll get a snack, it's a snack stand.
As I'm walking down the steps, the counselor turns to the kids and goes,
ten minutes! You've got ten minutes!
Basically giving these monsters permission
to go to the snack bar, snack bar, the concession stand
and go to the bathroom, all of a sudden
These animals start pouring down the stairs and then I look they're running by me like like like we're like
It's a war of the worlds. We're trying to get on the ferry in war of the worlds
And they're knocking into me running past me
I just knew I was and then I look the snack stand the concession stand
It was like there was like 50 kids online at it
So it's like well there goes any chance of any snacks that's out and then
then I go into the little boys room and I'm in there and you know there's not a
filth mouth show so as I'm in there I'm washing my hands after certain
activities
And then I'm at the guy at the sink next to me. There's a guy at the sink next to me and he's going to the movie and
I
Almost thank you know it just shows you you shouldn't open your mouth
Like I almost said something to the guy like I was so close to saying man. I hope these little mutants don't ruin
the movie
Like cuz oh the other thing is I know I literally when I saw those kids on the line
Was on the line. I said to myself. You know what? I'm not gonna get my showing of this movie ruined
I went up to the ticket window because it was sold out and I said to the woman. I have an extra ticket. I didn't say I
Didn't say I yeah, I only have one ticket and I'm looking to sell it
I said I have an extra ticket if anyone wants it
Point them out to me over on the apartment. Please send them my way on the line over there
and I will sell it to him and thankfully you know nobody showed up because
otherwise I was ready to just cash out we'll fight this fight another day not
gonna see it at one o'clock so I'm in the in the bathroom and I almost say to
this guy almost so close I once said man I hope these mutants don't ruin the
movie these little mutants because then he turns in two kids in blue t-shirts
come in and they start talking to him so it's clear he's a counselor I almost
like I was so close to saying it but I didn't I bit my lip and that's it that's
something we all could learn you know what you don't have to say the first
thought that comes to your mind that's advice for all of us it's a strange
Exactly. You don't have to say it. Two things in life. You don't have to say things that
just pop into your head. And the other thing you never, ever, ever do is tell anybody,
oh, you look like so-and-so. It's always offensive. Unless you're going to say to a woman, you
look like Angelina Jolie, or to a guy, you look like Brad Pitt. Those are literally the
only two people
what are you going to say
hey you know you look like uh... you look like charles derning
in that uh...
you know
all you get you look like uh...
you look like that guy uh...
you know you look like that guy from uh... my name is erl his brother
you like
like things like when people say those things it's always insulting
yeah hey you know who you look like uh...
you ever see uh...
yeah
it's like
you look like that uh...
that uh... that uh... that uh... that guy from uh... from clerks
yet the one with the the one behind the count of the good clerk
like the good clerk
what you're offended by that
always offensive
people should never ever ever ever do that
mike says he told a guy looks like jimmy steward was it was he offended
don't do that anymore mike
jimmy stored
because either he's heard it a thousand times
and doesn't want to hear it again
it's like oh hey you know you look like bill part cells
as horrendous looking
so it's going to compare you to that
all man you know you look like you look like uh...
Yeah, Max Perlick.
So he sees mutants.
Nobody wants to be compared to these people.
Yeah, you look like a thin John Goodman.
Oh, wow.
Geez, geez, thanks.
So don't ever do that to anybody ever.
That's just a side-to-side bar.
So then the movie starts.
And then, strangely enough, the kids are quiet.
And all I'm doing is I'm looking over at them, just like which one of you is going to start talking.
I'll find you.
And then, my focus was taken away by the kids at the other side of the theater yelling.
the good and the movie starts saying oh they're gonna ruin it they're gonna
ruin it then they show the watch man a watchman trailer which I'm not again I
said it on rather a conversation with Paul Sheer and Jason Wallener that movie
looks like a there's no reason yeah oh wait what are they gonna make the
Watchman movie I can't wait to watch who cares the watchman movie
You enjoy the comic book. Just enjoy the comic book
Why do you have to see it brought to life?
Not even everywhere. Oh, it's the greatest comic book ever. No, it's not it isn't
It's far from the greatest comic book ever it's an important comic book
But it's like a it's like a homework comic book at this point. Oh, you have to read it to

Cake versus pie, which one do you like?
I've actually got the right answer to that.
We'll find out which one people like.
I'm not stealing Tyriel.
Oh, buddy.
Batman.
The thing that made me say that is,
And somebody once said, I looked like a thin version of a horrifying person, which upset
me so much that I just waged that.
I hate that person now for that.
I hate that.
That's how upsetting it is.
Oh, what?
No, give you a hint.
I'm doing this for free.
This is not some confessional thing, laying myself out here.
start paying me by the big bucks. People start telling me to pay me a big
bucks. I'll start opening my wrists, pouring my my real life stuff out. I'm
punching in for free over here. I'm on the I'm on the clock for free.
And how is it? How is it that I'm doing this for free so many years later? I've
I've never gotten one solitary call from anyone
in PR, satellite radio.
No one wants this.
No one wants it.
It is mind boggling.
Some of the driftwood that's on those stations.
And they don't want this, they don't want it.
How is that possible?
That this show has become what it is and that gets zero respect.
Car talk, that gets respect.
talk. Two guys talking about fixing your carburetor. Yeah, it sounds like your carburetor is broken.
And those guys are drawing a paycheck. And there's a cartoon of that now. It's like an animated
thing where? Oh, on PBS. That's where everybody turns into watch animated shows. PBS. Animation
on PBS what's next Nova gonna do Nova anime Nova

things driving me nuts you know as a book out now Tori Spelling Tori Spelling
has a book at Tori spelling one Tom zero. I usually start writing comic books. Maybe
that's got to be my entry point. I'll give up on, I'll just start writing. Yeah, I wouldn't
hear a peep though. No respect. Nothing at all. I'm the phantom over here doing my show

the dreams die
cake versus pie at your on the air fm you
Oh, thank you. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. I was thinking pie. You think pie is better. Yes, because I've been thinking of pie.
You, sir, are wrong. Okay, by the way, you know you were talking about getting offended by getting compared to somebody.
Yeah. I had a friend who called me up out of the blue hitting her for a minute and months.
Yeah. He was all excited and he said, double where's Prada ever see that movie?
I have he compared me to Stanley Tucci. That's terrible. I know you're talking about how you get
offended. I was thinking, well, you know, first of all, I thought, you know, this man's also a writer,
a director. That's the ethical performer. He said, there's worse people you can get compared to.
I mean, at least he didn't compare me to some serial killer, but he was all excited. But here's
here's the thing that affected me is
this person doesn't bother call me for a month
forgive me uh... or anything so all of a sudden you don't hear from the
scowl says like
you know you look like
family to cheat and uh... that was product click
at some friends i was at some circle of friends you got there
yeah and he just said that we have to see it
although i wasn't interested in seeing it
he said i swear to you but he wouldn't shut up about it anyway
his mannerisms are like you with the way
the way he walks is exactly like you and you just went on and on about it
you know that you know that friend should be called an ex friend
yes well i
have a contact that you want to get back to cake versus pie
do you want to know why there's a difference
do you know what i know why you are completely wrong
one word
Icing.
Icing.
But pie will spill over.
Yeah.
What's that, Mike?
You say pie has filling?
Exactly.
Anytime, Mike, you've gone to a food drive, like a charity thing.
How many times when you look in that box, Mike, have you seen icing, cake icing?
But how many times have you seen pie filling right right how many times have you seen
pie filling in there or what's your experience frosting not icing I'm being corrected frosting
I call it no I'm changing it it's icing it's icing yes that's a compliment is what makes
i think on the cake is what makes it exciting icing on the cake thank you
anybody because of frosting i think they're wrong
and whatever says well that's filling in the pie
exactly so the but if you see the pie uh... if you see the the the pie
in the uh... yeah because if you're eating out of a can
you're eating if you're eating pie filling
there's been some sort of disaster
but right
that's funny right
you know it's funny though you ever wonder
you look at on the other hand
you're reading the reading icing
out of a can
that's like heaven
that's the best thing ever
how is it though
that there has never been some enterprising pothead
that has figured out a way to put uh...
icing on a pie
yeah i don't know about that i've never seen that right
but you know what what you can do on some cake
what you can put that off my phone i don't care

I know you're gonna disagree with me because for every every cake with good topping her a good
You know topping out. There's always that one with that banana filling and I'm just I hate the banana filling that alone makes me hate cake
I'm more of a fan of a blueberry pie or a nice pumpkin pie in me.
A pumpkin pie.
I will say though, the pumpkin pie is the Cadillac of pies.
It's a great one.
Do you like whipped cream or no?

In a cinnabon.
He came to cinnabon working with you?
No, no, no. He was there to buy one.
Okay.

No. Oh, Martin, what are we going to do with you?

You ever, you know, uh, you know, uh, do you remember tower video?
Remember tower video? I used to work at tower video.

Yes, I can't do this anymore.
FMU, you're on the air.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi, I'm here to talk about the topic.
What's the topic, cake versus pie?
versus pie
uh... unless you've changed it since
go ahead well what do you got to say
um...
i hate to disagree with you but uh... i've got to say pie
why is that
um... honey
i've had good cakes and i've had bad cakes
but uh... pie is just better on average remember had like a really bad pie
well you're you're a better pie selector i don't have to tell you
well what's a bad cake you had
I'm not a big fan of like the triple chocolate, whatever.
Yeah, you're right.
That's all that chocolate ew, right?
Yeah.
Yummy chocolate.
And then they always go with like the bittersweet ones.
And you never want a bitter cake.
Maybe a whatever weird cake plays you're reading.
And off my phone.
First of all, why is this actually a topic now?
FMU, you're on the air.
Hi, Tom.
i don't know i'm listening in Seattle i'm kind of a fan of your show this is
exactly the second time i've called great thanks joe
yeah
uh... i'm going to cast my vote for a pie
i know you might not like that but uh...
i have my reasons
and i thought i had a couple of stories
relating to this week's uh...
this week's business of uh...
being compared to a celebrity and last week's of actually running into a
celebrity
who did you run into
well it was a long time ago in new york city
and uh... for a brief
well it felt like an eternity because i was a fan at the time and still hamming
away i uh...
still in the sidewalk next to mister david burn
and i was trying to make up my mind if i should say something to him or not i
decided not to
because
he happened to be with a rainy night and he was uh...
carrying a child
He had an umbrella and I did this thing, there used to be a bookstore down in Soho that
sold or sell art postcards and art books and you could go in there and think of any artist
Joseph Campbell, Paul Clear, whatever, and look it up like you're looking up CDs and
there's beautiful postcards in there and my friends and I were in there and I stepped
outside to look at what was in the window in the sky, walked up like I say with an umbrella
I was standing there and I kind of, you know, I glanced at him, which is a good idea.
What color umbrella?
It was black.
Black.
Yeah.
Nice umbrella?
I didn't look that long because one of those ones that you can fold, are they one of the
ones that fold up nice and tight or is it like a classy one where you're just saying
like, hey, I got a nice umbrella with a nice wooden handle?
It was a pretty nice umbrella.
Nice umbrella.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sturdy.
Sturdy, okay.
Yeah.
Not something that you would forget on the subway.
One person?
Two person umbrella?
person okay but it had actually now now I think of it it did have a significant
arc to it not like those old 70s you know bubble type describe the arc we
are yes let's get into this get off my phone is that how they roll out there in
Seattle guess I do talk about umbrellas it's raining all the time there
FM you're on the air. Hello? Yeah. Hi, it's Nina from Boot and New Jersey. Nina from
Boot and how are you tonight Nina? Good. Well, I wanted to say a story I had about when
I was at the movies past week watching Batman. No spoilers. Don't give any spoilers. No,
no, no, no. No? Well, I was watching the movie and it was starting. And this guy next
and he calls someone inside the theater and uh...
he says
uh...
he starts screaming like not screaming but loudly
i can see your pet
and the lady turns around and they start having a conversation during the
movie
me like he knew someone else in the theater
wow okay
that's uh... that's horrible
yet was the movie actually playing at that point
yes it was that's terrible i'm sorry
Sorry, you have a good night madam. Oh, okay

FM you're on the air. Hello. Hello. Hi this is Ryan. Ryan from Minneapolis. How are you
tonight Ryan? I'm doing well. How about yourself? I'm doing pretty good. That's good. I'm just
here to say that I'm tired of all these pro pie people. What's what I just don't like
pie. Alright. I'm not a fan. I just really don't like the crust. It really bothers me.
You like cake right? Of course I do. What's your favorite kind of cake? Mmm. I would
say like chocolate with vanilla I think. Mmm. When's the last time you had a nice bite
of chocolate cake? That's been too long. Too long. Why don't you go get some tonight?
We'll do. Where would you get cake from? Where's your favorite place to get cake from?
gas station
uh... actually there's a co-op
across the street that has really good cake co-op
co-operation
i think it's worth and four
and what kind of cake do they have
uh... they have
probably raisins in it
the raisins in it
i hope not
i think they have like that gluten-free stuff which is okay
you know what
go get some cake tonight you earned it buddy
you earned it
fm you you're on the air
i think both uh... pie and cake serve their uh...
purposes and i i i think uh...
we should include all of them
all really okay i i i you know i look as somebody i'm a fan of both
i like cake
and i like pie i just like cake a little better
That's great, that's big progress.
Hey, I was wondering if you could do something for me?
Sure.
I would love to hear something called Big Dippers.
Big Dippers, Big Dipper?
What's that?
Big Dipper?
Is that a rock group?
Yes, but it's not a plural, it's Big Dipper.
Oh, okay, I may have gotten the name wrong.
Okay, I'm writing this down.
A friend of mine was talking about them,
and I was curious to see what they sounded like.
Yeah, yeah, that's one of my favorite groups.
Oh good, okay, well I'd love to hear it.
All right, if I have a music break later,
I'll try to play some, sure.
So you won't play it now?
I'm not this many, we're kind of doing a phone thing.
Okay, what there's no need for that tone?
I'm sorry, whoa.
It sounded like you were getting a little riled.
No, I'm not playing music this second.
If I play music, I'll try to play some big dipper for you.
Oh, okay. Well, here's what I want you to do, host, okay?
Uh-huh. Okay.
I want you to take several deep breaths,
and I want you to get in your joy space, okay?
And I want you to think about Dogmo before you say anything else that you might regret at some point, okay?
What did you just say a second?
Wait, what did you say about the joy space?
Yeah.
Who is this?
It's Dr. Myers.
Why?
Dr. Myers. Yeah, why are you you can't call me and then you know and and say my dog by my dog and all this stuff
And this okay, yeah, I just got to say if people listening it's like
this guy with this dr. Meyer you were my therapist for the last couple years and
You retired recently
But you can't call me on the radio
you know cut you know of obvious relationship i just i i want to hear
what the
what your show sounded like i hope that that's not weird you know i i i
i figured it would be wrong to listen to you
while you were still
a patient of mine no that's horribly weird
what's up with this guy spike
he's a guy who calls it's just one of the callers who calls
you if you all you really let him have it don't you
well if you know it's a back you know i'm not comfortable with it and i i
also listen to uh...
what he called the uh...
the archive that was called
you were listening to archive that there was this bald guy with the name
james
yes they're all my god you really let him have it too yeah
now i really thought that we've made progress
but judging by what i've heard it doesn't seem like it
but that you know what and and if gabby from winnipeg
uh... uh-huh you do you just let her go like the instant she didn't
didn't uh...
fit your uh...
you know your needs i'd i'd
this is terrible
but the this is part of the show i mean you can't
it's not meant for me to
i'm not putting this
fourth for you to
analyze
you know i mean you used to be my shrink
and then you retired and it's like
this is
something outside of that
well i can still talk about it i mean you know that
this is not like that doctor
patient privilege thing in it
oh yeah i would say it's definitely about doctor patient privilege
that that ends when the doctor retired
out i don't know it doesn't i'm almost
I'm like 99% positive. I'm like 99% positive. Well, I'm 100% positive that it doesn't end because you decided to stop practicing
How about this? I'll look it up later, okay? Uh-huh, but I'm pretty sure it does. Hey, you said that, you know, speaking about my name retired
Yeah, I've got a lot of extra time on my hands now and
I'd really like to talk to you about that idea that you had for basketball jerseys for pets
you mean that I met that I mentioned about what they say like six weeks ago
I talked about that yeah yeah I made a large note about it I think it's a great
idea and I want to invest well it was just something that I was throwing
around as a loose concept and it's definitely not something that I was
looking to start talking about publicly on my radio show and it's
definitely something
that i would not something that i wanted to talk to you about investing in on the
radio
my my my therapist on paying you
for that i i think that's a huge
breach of of
of territory
were you thinking of free-standing stores or like a web-based operation
because i think it's web-based
then uh...
it's there's way more access and you know unless you're thinking of like going
the roof like a piercing pagoda like it uh...
at the mall or something now you know what
i guess that initially i had thought it could start as a web-based business
and if it's great okay i'm writing that down no that's great
okay
that's that's fine it's a designer in mind
give a designer in mind no i don't have a designer it was a loose concept
i know the guy another patient i had oh my god
this guy that is all this rocker another patient yeah yeah
well i i don't want to know about any other patient you have okay well
things rick
okay that's enough knowledge i you know
so it's like
well i want to say that it sounds like you're putting up your defense is an
and i i want to say this
well it is i mean that that's a recurring problem and i wonder i want to
reassure you right now
there's no need to do that because
nobody's gonna steal your wacky packages again
what's that
nobody's gonna steal your wacky packages again i know that that was a very
life-defining moment for you yeah like when i was like three yeah that kid
baron plopleton yes he's he stole your wacky pack yeah and i gotta say though
i'm i'm impressed slash mortified that that you've you've kept up a relationship
with this guy yes yeah well it did it that's part of me as a functioning adult
why am i talking about well no i thought that you were so scared of him that that
you made this uh this relationship work well what do you ever think that
that your shot that that I'm making character the thing work yeah with other
people I would have cut him loose years and years ago after he did that to me
okay well that's fine you know you're scrambling my head right now okay what
though what here here okay listen I it sounds like you're getting mad okay yes
and that is good okay okay yeah because I know that this is just how you felt when
You got home from school that day and you found your brother dumb eating all your fudge, right?
That was a very
Frustrating thing, but that was also something that happened when I was what seven? Yes, but now
You have the tools to deal with your blind rage, right?
Blind rage. Yes. Is that what you're calling it?
That's how I always thought yes, and instead of trying to flash your brother's face with a fake knife
I I want you to transmute those feelings of absolute hatred in the feelings of absolute pleasure, okay?
Okay, now once again, I want you to go to your pleasure place, okay?
Uh-huh, okay, you're lying on that beat to chip bottom, right? Uh-huh, okay
And you know you're with Lonnie Anderson, right? I
Don't want to talk about this on the radio and she come on. We've done this a hundred times in private. Well, I

new to the school. It was a new area for me and I was just afraid. I was picked on a lot for my
ghastly appearance and physical weight problems and bed acne, heavy big shoulders, big bones.
I had a very bad glandular issue. I sweat a lot and I was just so much. I felt like such an outcast
And I've just been working through it so hard, but I never had anyone really to talk to to tell me that everything was okay.

ok finally you're all realizing it
thank you for life
our reporting later things do
fm you you're on the air
it's almost wonderful to get into the uh...
The conversation about cake versus pie, but just from a comedic standpoint, I'm wondering
what's funnier, getting hit with the pie or like when someone falls face first into
a cake.
Well first of all I'm going to ask you, is there any way you can switch to a phone with
more treble?
Is there any way you can switch to a more shrill sounding phone?
Let me adjust my, I have knobs on the phone I can try and adjust to hold on.
Yes, if there's any way you can work the bass out of this completely so that your voice
literally just sounds like a screeching speaker in a train station.
I can try talking deeper than that.
Get off my phone!
This is not clown time.
These people talk about this stuff.
Get your phone in order before you call.
I've bought them doubt.
I've bought them doubt.
I got nothing.
Thirty-three and a third.
They don't want me.
I suggest that I suggest something to them.
They didn't want to hear it.
It's because there's a middle of nowhere by Hanson.
Hanson's debut major label album. They didn't want nothing to do with it.
They told me to go pack up and shuffle off.
Comic books. I should be right. There's no reason I can't write a comic book.
Think anybody from Marvel Comics, DC Comics wants to hear from me? No.
Tori Spelling's got that book out. I got nothing.
one
one to see to to the theater last night to see see some theater
at the of the of comedy shop called comics, a comedy club down on the 14th
In which I have seen entertainers like Paul of Tompkins. By the way, this cake versus pie thing. That's one of his routines
and I
Was doing that as a joke when I said I don't steal nothing from nobody and I stole it
Then I stole that right from him and for the last 40 minutes
I've had to pass that off as if that was not something lifted wholesale from his act
We need more Tompkins ologists out there.
People pay attention to this stuff.
But anyway, I saw Wasp Cove, the third installment, and final installment of their first season.
Top notch, get ready for the new season coming in October.
Top notch, David Rakeoff, Julie Klausner.
If people were stocks, you'd buy stock in, uh, in, uh, Julie Clavner, KLSR or whatever
it would be.
You'd buy that stock.
My stock, I'd be laying there.
I'd be like Yahoo.
Flatlining.
Flatlining.
I got nothing.
I got nothing going on.
No perks, no nothing.
Unbelievable.
No perks.
You'd think I'd have some juice.
That's what Stevie Blue always talked about, juice.
I got no juice.
I gotta start juice in it.
I gotta get the juice.
I got no juice.
Stevie Blue always talked about the juice.
The show is juice free.
Sick
What else we got to talk about here all the Benagan's are going out of business it's very disappointing
They will there are only what are people gonna do there's only 95 more of those awful
Chains that are exactly like Benagan's everywhere
there. What are we going to do now? I guess we have to eat at Applebee's, TGI Fridays,
Ruby Tuesdays. You throw a rock, you hit one of those awful places. I ended up eating
at, I think, an Applebee's with my family. I'm telling you, it took me 10 minutes to
figure out something that I could eat there, and I had to basically re-engineer the food
with the waiter
hold the bacon
and then i don't want
the bacon
salad dress
bacon salad dressing
people eat that much bacon
the salad literally had bacon on it
and then a bacon salad dressing
how much bacon do you want
and that's really come out the things got no
it's got no bacon salad dressing on everything's covered in bacon
These guys can't help it. They can't help but put bacon on stuff.
It's gross bacon salad dressing.
What do you have? What do these people have against the animals?
What do you have against that? You want to wipe them all out?
FM you, you're on the air.
Hey, it's Monica. Hey, how are you? Good. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. How are you tonight?
Real good. Thank you
Um, I want to know if you had an opinion on the season premiere of mad men. I did not watch it. Ah
You know what? I didn't click with mad men. I know it's sacrilegious
No, no, I think it's kind of overhyped. I stopped watching partway through the first season because it wasn't
And it wasn't killing me.
Yeah, I'm tired of reading about madmen, but I did watch the full first season, I watched
the premiere, and it's serious with the Capitol F.
That's exactly it.
The only fun on it seems like it's fun that it's like, can you believe how it was back
then?
Yeah, and I don't know, I just think it's really a bit, it's a little pretentious.
Yes. I got my fill of that stuff in the back to the future.
Well, I don't know. I just, I just, I'm tired of reading about mad men and then
when I saw the premiere I was a bit let down. Now it starts back up. It's what, 1979?
Uh, 62. 62. Yeah, 14 months later.
14 months late so it picks up 14 months late I just got an I am somebody saying
please encourage your listeners to talk about Joan who's Joan oh Joan is the
queen bee of the steno pool she's the red head she's the red head yeah she's
the red head she's the the very curvaceous yeah hotty who's having an
ongoing
affair with uh...
cooper of cooper sturling
or sturling i think
of cooper sturling
and uh... the guy played by john slattery
but now she's banging on
a doctor who she's waiting
to uh...
if he's going to propose to work so this is so this shows like a soap opera
basically
it is a soap opera it's a soap opera with pretenses of the soap opera that
it's sort of been uh...
i'd just think it's been
overhaled and
i'm wait i hope that there's a backlash to to madmen because i'm
it's it's too precious
i didn't watch general hospital
i didn't watch a one-life to live
i will not watch madmen
what do you think about
mayberry rfd and i know that i'm not being silly i'm just
serious it's a serious question i i was i i like uh... the anti-growth of show
i was not any river show the first yes
the first permutation of things and then the black and white version
i do not know uh...
mayberry rfd i was not uh... a viewer of maya berry rfd
is it on nickelodeon now uh... tv land i've been watching and well it's i'm
maybe it's the anti-growth of show if the anti-growth of show that i've been
watching
but i was surprised at how much i actually love
those early episodes of the Andy Griffith Show.
That's a good show.
That's top notch.
And Don Knots is pretty amazing.
Nobody comes close to Don Knots.
Thank you.
What he did.
I'm happy to hear that.
I love Andy Griffith.
And I love Andy Griffith Show.
Yeah.
And Andy Griffith playing a straight guy.
That's sort of an under song role.
but you know
he he really pulled it off and i love that show
the least rewarding role in the whole thing
it is
so i'm just curious do you have any shows that you think we should be checking out
this uh...

saving grace it's a billboard for the closer and it showed like
her and the cast of characters are like thirty one people standing behind her
i know
you know what i love the closer i hate saving grace
that's the one with holly hunter as the uh...
yeah that they uh... tough cookie
it's almost like a vanity project for holly hunter and they're trying to really
you know proper up to be as
hot as the closer but the closer really is fun
i have to watch the closer i just i did not uh... i did not give the close or
a chance
you'll give it it's just to i'm sure mike is asking what the close or closes
the closer closes cases
and what did you think it was mike
yet i think it was doors

i never mentioned the mask mike where did i've ever mentioned you wear a mask
No, he wears a mask. I don't know what he looks like behind that mask.
It's like a phantom of the opera mask.
And a cape.
Mike wants to know the difference between the cleaner and the closer.
I don't know.
I think the cleaner...
Yeah, I don't know.
the cleaner, and of course the closer closes out the cases that they can't put away. She
steps in and makes it happen. The cleaner, I have no idea. Putting a topic on the table
at 1024. Best and worst celebrity iTunes playlists. Let's find them. Let's see
who's got the best, who's got the worst, 201-209-9368. FMU you're on the air. Hey
Hey, who's this?
This is Isabelle from Rochester.
How are you, Isabelle?
I'm doing pretty good. How about you?
I'm doing all right.
Well, I actually called before there was a topic, so I'm caught off a little out of guard.
That's fine. What do you have for me, Isabelle?
Well, I don't know. I'm a recent follower of this show. I had never heard about it before.
but I really do appreciate it.
It's really helped me out a lot, actually.
Oh, good.
That's sweet for you to say, how did you find the show?
Actually, when my friend was really into it,
and I was in the car with her, and she's playing it,
and I was really tired, but I just couldn't get to sleep.
And she put it on, and I just knocked out like a baby.
Oh, that's great.
Get off my phone.
Was she taking a shot at me?
She got me.
How dare you?
Unbelievable.
That's what I get, zilch.
I'm at zero right now.
I should be like a god around this place.
I get nothing from nobody, no respect,
no gratitude, no nothing.
Unbelievable.
You know what, that's why I'm getting rammed, this shows closer to the end than to the beginning.
I'm telling you, not next week, Mike, but the week after, my protege is going to be
in the studio, H-Man, a young man named H-Man, who I picked out of the sea of young radio
people.
I have found the one who was meant to replace me, H-Man is his name.
You'll be live in the studio in two weeks.
Oh, you'll be his call screener.
I'm going to transition.
Everything stays the same, except I remove myself from the picture.
It'll be you and H-Man.
What else is going on?
Benaganz.
Talk about that.
Man, the celebrity iTunes thing is blowing away the phones.
Look at that.
Absolute silence.
Unbelievable.
This is the biggest L in the history of the show tonight.
Biggest L.
I'm just going to go read a magazine now.
I'm going to read Jazz Times magazine.
But the new issue has, uh, Rosson Roll and Kirk on the cover, recommended to me by Evan
Funk Davies.
And I was read this article in the issue, uh, there's an article called The Money Pit,
in this issue, about, uh, with only so many club gigs to go around in New York City, many
jazz musicians seek financial security working in Broadway pit orchestras.
And this is an article about jazz musicians who work in the pits of Broadway shows.
It's an article that the person's talking about Nick Marchione, who is a trumpeter who
plays for the producers with six years of playing on the producers. This article
was insane. He's been lucky in his Broadway gigs not only did the producers
last but his conductor on that show allowed him to horn in with embellishments
to the score on occasion to quote keep everybody actively listening and on
their toes.
But such creative license is a rarity on Broadway.
That fact is clear enough for Jason Jackson, another fine player, who filled the trombone
chair for the Oprah Winfrey produced Color Purple throughout the show's three year run,
while performing as much jazz as possible on the side with groups like the Dizzy Gillespie
All-Stars featuring Sly.
How do people get away with these All-Star things when the person died 40 years ago?
with Dizzy Gillespie's name on things, featuring Slide Hamilton, and Slide Hampton and James
Moody.
No such liberties could be enjoyed by Marchione and Green could be taken in his pit.
No improvisation, no jokes, and talk had to be kept to a minimum.
Library appropriate whisper is appreciated.
Yeah.
Why is that some negative thing?
talking like like oh man they're cracking the whip on the musicians in the in the
orchestra pit they're not allowed to talk at full volume I'm dropping a hundred
bucks to see this show I don't want to hear to get distracted by laughter coming
out of the pit because the musicians are bored
supposed to be watching the producers just actually with the producers might I
might appreciate if those guys spoke up a little bit. Couldn't be worse than what was
going on on the stage. I was going to see the producers like when Nathan Lane and Matthew
Broderick came back and was like, they're back! And then I saw on the Curb Your Enthusiasm
they showed what the producers would have been like when like Larry David was in it
and I was like, no way. Seems like the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. Terrible
song like that unfunny kind of humor where it's like like vaudeville
it's like didn't we run that stuff out in like the 50s didn't like radio stop
this stuff like a Fibber McGee and Molly ran that stuff all out of town the
shadow
and why did they make a movie of the shadow
like ten years ago for a look Baldwin
we got the rights to the shadow it's going to be great
everyone's gonna see it
everyone loves the character the shadow
you know there's no way anyone who worked on that movie
knew about like the intricacies of the shadow
without someone explaining it to them like
someone had to go and learn about the shadow
at some point
and then that person taught
someone else what the shadow was
because no none of the people who
worked on that show
on that movie knew the shadow
let's make sure we're true to the character of the shadow
what did he like but now nobody knows the shadow
who knows what looks in the heart of men
who knows whether the shadow was a
carefree playboy by day
nobody knows
the shadow
great
the shadow is out in theaters now
you think anybody like eighty five-year-old is like i finally a shadow movie
take me to do see the shadow
people go to the theater
it's got the uh... two eighty five-year-old guys in it
and even they thought the movie stunk
revive a character like the shadow
back to this jazz article
surrendering his individuality musically personally hasn't always come easy
jackson
at heart of jazz guy who enjoys improvising and hanging with the laid-back
musicians
he plays with in jazz gigs
he understands broadway's a high-stakes uh... high-pressure environment a
in quotes business
how was that in quotes
course it's a business
a business
throwing diverse musicians together in tight surroundings and every pit responds
with its own culture
and this guy has no problem with it it's the author of this article has a
problem with the idea that these guys aren't allowed to uh... i'm supposed to
go see a broadway show
and it's like uh...
so we would uh... it's supposed to say i'm going to see uh... you know uh...
uh... the state fair and uh...
some guys we go
uh...
yeah cut loose
cut loose jazz man
go crazy i don't want you to be constricted
to the music written by uh... rogers and hammer stein
how dare you be held back by those composed songs
that the people on stage are trying to sing
uh...
uh...
i'm imitating a song bird
I'm just going to watch the actors watching you, the actors are looking down at the pit
wondering when you're going to start playing state fair again, so they can dance to it.
Yeah, jazz is about freedom.
And the back page of this magazine has the final chorus by Nat Hentoff.
He writes a thing called his jazz black music.
You know what?
Really have to go there now.
Like jazz is already on the run.
This guy's trying to divide the nine people left who care about jazz.
He's trying to get them to fight each other.
It's like, be happy that you found that there's nine people who still care about jazz.
You're trying to get them into a fight.
Trying to introduce like, just trying to make everything put an edge into it.
It's not enough arguing.
We're not fighting enough.
Please, Nat, be happy anybody cares, but jazz still, FMU you're on the air.
Hi, Tom.
Hey, it's Lori.
Hi.
Lori.
Tom.
From Miami.
Yes.
I was never so upset.
I know I usually don't mention the Friends of Tom message board, but I'm going to.
No, and also I'm not going to do Paul's jazz bit.
Paul's Miami wants me to do his whole show.
I'm down to the gang of thong! Get up!
What I'm going to do is uh... CD impersonal in stores now.
So, I went to the friends at Tom's site.
Okay.
And some loud mouth wrote a thing complaining that you call every week.
I didn't call every single week.
You want to know what?
Yeah.
Lori?
Yeah.
you ready for this I'm ready Mike who are power callers on the show who are
the power callers
paycheck paycheck in Toronto Erica in Baltimore Dave and Knoxville
Mm-hmm tonight
There's a fourth power caller
Lori in Miami. Oh, wow. I don't know what to say
Thank you. You earned it. Oh, thank you. I
Have something for the topic. Let's hear it. So um, I
Do go to these celebrity playlists every now and then and I noticed on steel
and Heidi Klum's playlist. Yes. There are thirteen songs on here. Thirteen. Four of them are
steel songs. So she put her husbands. No, no, it's not just her because it's the two of them.
Oh, it's the two of them together. He also put his own songs on there. So he basically put his,
what did he put the Batman song in there? He put gifts from a rose on there and he said the first
time i discovered love with his own song
yeah and another one which is called violet
yeah
and he says knowing i had to set a loved one free
the worst one that's not the Marvin Gaye one these are not
the the celebrity play these are celebrity playlists not liner notes to
your album i know but the worst one is
track number eight and the only words he puts
there are teenage discovery and it's for Marvin Gaye's song yeah power caller
Laurie yeah well done thank you have a good night you do bye FM you you're on
the air Tom yes it's Joe from Seattle calling back oh great hey I didn't mean
to offend you with the word parabola what happened before I don't know
everything just stopped when I said the word parabola I'm not sure I'm not sure
what I'm not sure what went on you called and just I can't remember I've
assumed he calls tonight oh it's fine I was telling a story about David David
Byrne and you're interested in the curve of the umbrella yeah I'm gonna use the
word parabola and then everything went dead on my end so
If I'm you, you're on the air yeah, Tom. Yeah, this is John
Got some iTunes playlists. What are you calling from John?
It's pretty obvious but Carlos Mencia has probably the worst one
Let's see it
Who's uh?
It's not not even so much the songs. It's what he says about them
Like any RDS lap dance
he put it on because he knows that the band is multi-racial and he gets pumped
up to make fun of everyone when he listens to it
that's disgusting
and uh...
he likes to sing everybody hurts
when uh... one of its friends
is having a uh... a bad day
to uh... to offend them
so what what is this guy just on a mission to offend everybody
uh...
pretty much look that way
carlos missy that's pretty that's a that's a good one
although
dane cook
is the worst because he wrote like
two paragraphs for each song
course he did he wrote two unfunny
off the cuff paragraphs
do you want to hear his uh... description of my name is jones by
leader
let's hear it
Sometimes when I meet someone, I've never met before.
I start by saying, my name is Jonas.
I'm carrying the wheel.
When the person gets a positive look on their face
and I say, the next line, thanks for all you've shown us,
but this is how we feel.
I keep going with the song until they either catch on
or walk away massively frustrated by my riddle.
Someday I hope the person stays
until I get to march in circles hollering,
the workers are going home.
You know, else is going home, his fans are going home.
They're all leaving him in droves.
That guy's the worst.
Thank you, John.
Thanks, Tom.
Whoops.
FMU, you're on the air.
Hey, Tom.
How you doing?
I'm doing all right.
Who's this?
This is Daniel up in Boston.
Daniel in Boston.
Are you looking forward to Spike arriving in Boston?
You know, I'm terrified.
If I don't even know why.
You should be terrified.
Why not?
What do you got for me buddy?
Sylvester Stallone?
Who's on Sylvester Stallone's celebrity playlist?
Well, believe it or not, I, the Tiger by Survivors, on there.
Yeah, there's a shock.
A song that fills you with complete attitude.
Um, if you've got Born on the Bayou by Credence,
instantly transports me into the swamps of Louisiana.
Yeah, I wish you would.
I wish that was possible.
but that the best of all he has into the night by benny mark donut
no wait this is his playlist from uh...
this is his playlist from nineteen eighty four
december two thousand six
he realizes that the music has happened since uh...
rocky three
i don't think he has anything on here that's newer than about
yeah nineteen eighty six or so does he have anything from his brother on
there
he does not know it's the uh...
he seems to have uh... avoided the
the nepotistic impulse at least but
yeah i'm sure he's trying to talk about the rocky force on track
i'm sure his brother love that
thanks buddy
fm you you're on the air
hey tom
hey um... who's this
it's about gonna actually want to apologize
hmm are you wait are you waking up
yeah no i i actually do like the show and i i feel like uh... i don't know why
I did that honestly, I'm sorry.
Oh, that's all right.
So I'm not, I hope I'm not boring you right now.
Are you starting to doze off a little bit?
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, no, no, I'm not going to, I don't, yeah.
No, I'm just sorry, I feel like that was a really
jerk thing to do.
You're trying to get me, aren't you?
Are you trying to bring me down?
You know, I, I shouldn't have, that was, that was.
It's explained, it's explained.
What was the goal?
What was the goal?
You don't like me?
Well, I'm not very goal-oriented, so I guess there wasn't one.
You don't like me?
I'm a loudmouth?
No, I think I actually do like you.
I mean, I've never met you before, so...
Jeepers.
Oh, I hope you can warm up to me and maybe like me.
Get off my phone.
I don't need you.
There's no more room on the bus.
There's no more room on the bus.
No more room on the bus. She calls again, Mike. You tell her there's no more room on the bus.
Sure, I get no juice with anything. 33 and third people think I'm a human garbage.
Nobody cares about me in any other way, shape, or form in terms of any other projects or anything I might be involved in.
There's all I got right now. It's microphone. All I got is microphone. It's
microphone right now. My iTunes and the truth. All I got is microphone. The rest
is up to you. FMU, you're on the air. Hey Tom, Nate from St. Paul. Nate from St.
Paul, how are you doing? Doing all right. How are you doing? Doing all right. Excellent.
I found a pretty baffling playlist celebrity playlist here on iTunes Steve Perry's playlist
uh-huh formerly of Journey yes exactly and first he should have been gone does he put
o sherry on there actually he does put two journey songs on his own playlist that he
sang on yes do these idiots not know how celebrity playlists go or are they actually
sitting around all day listening to their own music
well they're their live virgins so i suppose that makes it special it's even
worse
oh yeah i remember this night when i was on this tour is amazing
i remember was recorded yeah
i just don't believe it so who who's on the who's on that uh... celebrity
playlist
well actually i was going to say he does uh... decline from actually
discussing his own songs
The groups he has in his playlist seem kind of like I'm old, but I'm still with it.
That's even more arrogant by the way.
Yeah, my songs speak for themselves.
Just let the music do the talking with my stuff, but I'll tell you about this other
stuff I like.
Yeah.
So the first song in his playlist, Waterfalls by TLC.
Now that's one of the ones that's supposed to show that he's in it, he knows what's
what.
Yeah, and his blurb for that is when I first heard this tune, I knew it was going to be a hit.
Yeah, in 1998 and 1995.
Yeah, a little more recent, Gwen Stefani's Hollaback girl.
Yeah, that's only six years old.
Yeah, and outcast Heya, 2003.
This is, and it's like almost every single blurb on this is like, when I first heard this, I knew it was great.
If he wants to be an A&R now?
Yeah.
Good.
Steve Perry.
Thumbs down.
And thumbs up on your call.
Thanks, buddy.
Thank you.
FMU, you're on the air.
Hey, how are you tonight?
I'm doing all right.
How are you doing?
I'm doing good.
What's your name, young man?
My name is Joshua.
I love that you call me young man.
Where are you calling from, Joshua?
Call you from Burlington, New York.
My son, Joshua.
You know what's there?
So go ahead.
uh... for me
a while back that you were talking about the shadow and before the shadow you
were talking about the jazz musicians you know who are you know
think that he could be left the all-stars
guys who died forty years ago you
did you go up the dot in nineteen ninety three
and i go into church but when did he stop playing
he stopped playing in the lake the late eighties yeah okay so i was twenty
years ago he was only seventy five when he died well look i'm a look uh... god
god rest his soul
But I'm saying, what year did he die?
93.
OK, so 93.
So 15 years later, there's a band touring
with his name on the bill.
Yeah.
Nothing about it.
They're not calling it the Count Basie All-Stars,
or the Duke Ellington.
Oh, so it's just a matter of when the person died for you.
What's the line for you?
I just think 40 years and 15 are far enough apart.
Jeepers, I'm sorry.
It's only double digits.
if it's two days it's too much
all right well i just want to point out i'm free of other people are on hold but
i think you would think thanks uh... i'd like to be glad to be a lot of that
so do i
i'm just saying
it's weird uh... what is this and what is the fast do people go see it is
are they the original band members
i don't think so i am
they're probably guys who played with them toward the tail end of things
true
and they got somehow big
upon his death bed got him to sort of give him the right to use his name
yeah and i mean i'm sure they're playing his songs
you know what he's not there
he's there in spirit
he's probably not even there in spirit
his spirit is sick of watching that
i know dizzy's here watching us do uh...
do the same no he's not
his spirits probably bored by watching these guys play the same eleven songs
every night
again and again playing poorly
if they are probably probably probably probably actually don't get that many
gigs sadly but
you know i get all i got a lot of tory
are you a big jazz fan
they used to be a lot of ruffled your feathers
with my anti-jazz uh...
tirade
it's all good
talk that you're you're not one of the most entertaining personalities uh...
in the world right now
well there you go
thank you
you're welcome
thank you and on that note
I'm gonna head off and take care of my accounting work here that I got to do for my wife.
You want to know what? You have a good night, champ.

of looks at things.
Yeah, what is fun more?
Oh, what is it?
You don't own me.
Leslie Gore.
Leslie Gore, yes.

Let's go on a ride. Who's this? My name is Zany.
Zany. From Vancouver. From Vancouver. How are things in Vancouver tonight?
They are clearing up. They were a bit rainy,
as is par for this part of the world.
But I'm really excited to be calling.
Yeah, I've been listening for like a year, but I haven't been able to call in.
I'm so excited. Well, welcome to the show.
It's very nice of you to call.
Yeah, I was hit by an SUV earlier this week.
What?
And I am able to call because I'm
holed up at my parents' house recovering.
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
I'm OK.
What happened?
I was biking to work.
And I think this SUV was making an illegal turn
into a Starbucks.
It was about 6 in the morning.
and i was biking to work and they just uh...
came right into my lane
and what happened to you do you do you got your bike i crushed

and it means you get to hang out with your parents a little bit
which is good yes that's nice
oh so do you have anybody on the celebrity playlists
no i learned one thing that's cool about broken bones though what's that
is uh...
that all of the
christified calcium in broken bones
because they're in the form of crystals they actually radiate an electric field
there's actually electric current
like electricity that's generated by your by your broken bones
but that's about the most interesting thing that i've heard lately
i didn't know that
i didn't know that either
but they're it's quite an amazing world i've been looking into them
well i want you to heal up and get uh... and get better

thanks come
fm you you're on the air
hi tom hi who's this
this is uh... power-color erica from ball
power-color erica has a field to what are you excited about the newest power
caller
absolutely i love larry
there you go
good choice
very polarizing
she's like the peteros of power callers go you know
she's like the peteros of power either you love lory
or are you you can't stand there she doesn't exist no one in the middle
or you can't compare to pete rose
pete rose
what was that thinking
met him one time at a at a pharmacy convention signing autographs at a
booth
really
called me sweetheart yes uh-huh did you have that weird bull haircut
he had some crazy bright red hair it was
very odd. Red hair. Cheaper screech. So what do you got? What do you
got for us? Alright, I got, I got, and this is going to first
just sound like I'm calling and saying this person just to kind
of get to you, but there's a bigger reason here. Okay, no. Okay,
Kevin. It was either Kevin Smith or Diablo Cody. No, it's
Kevin Smith and it just happened to come up when I typed in
celebrity playlist because apparently he tried to submit his to apple and apple
said that his descriptions were too long
and so it got rejected at least that's what this
website is telling me yeah
well what songs did he pick
well he had some some head the first one with a james brown song of course
probably got the time on their right
it's actually a live version live making sixty eight thousand more auditorium
but what uh... what other stuff is on there is that james brown
he's got
he served by bill hicks which is from randy minor and then he got living in
sin by bonjovi and he says
some folks may feel like i've taught my street cred by ranking bill hicks and
bonjovi in the same playlist but
street read
and he says
basically <E.D.> them i'm from jersey what do you expect and then he goes into
this disgusting it like
it's vulgar wait he says something with uh... with uh... a litany of curses
really it was kevin smith the same kevin smith
i know it's amazing
and pulling the whole jersey card street cred
like to see him get some street cred
get that van uh... who knocked uh... zany offer bike
to give kevin smith a taste of that street cred
uh... it's a terrible probably break the van in half like uh...
like the thing in the, on the Fantastic Four trailer
when that truck hits him.
He also has straight out of Compton.
Of course he did.
And at George Carlin track.
Of course he had George Carlin, Bill Hicks, NWA,
James Brown.
See everyone.
I'm in honor.
That one at NC Comics.
And everyone, and he probably used some filth
describing that one.
People think I'm a peep for liking this song.
Actually, it's a really short description.

Johnny Cash, Tesla, and Kanye West.
And what's even creepier is that he pretty much admits in the description the only reason the Kanye West song is on there is because it references one of his movies.

like uh... it seems like there's a lot of celebrity talk
it like a given example
like uh...
you know we're talking about celebrity playlists
mmm-hmm and that's a lot of british
uh... the worst celebrities talented celebrities you know what it is i think
i think i saw that movie celebrity
and it's really just been staying with me
it really just has me thinking about like
celebrities
if you see that movie
uh... no i didn't
it's a good movie
Okay. Who made it?
A Woody Allen.
Okay.
It's called Celebrity.
It's one of his best movies.
Maybe I should go see it.
You should.
I don't know if it's in theaters anymore.
I'm not sure.
All right.
But it's really good.
It's got Kenneth Branagh.
You know him?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
He kind of plays the Woody Allen character in it.
I would say it's his best movie, personally.
Kenneth Branagh's pretty great.
He's pretty good.
He is great.
Did you see his remake of Sleuth?
That's one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I don't see that many movies, to be honest.
He was also good in Wild Wild West.
Okay.
He was good at the film.
Yeah, I thought that.
That was fun, right?
Uh, it's not really my thing, I guess.
Really?
Wild Wild West.
You like the music, though, right?
No.
Wild Wild West.
Not really.
Now what?
So you wanted me to talk less about celebrities?
You want me to make it more, uh, more normal stuff?
I don't want anything to change.
I think your show is great.

But you've got one thing to look forward to the Evan Funk Davey show is about to begin and
Man, oh man does he have an exciting show plan for you tonight?
Who he asked me to hype it up a little bit and I will do so is he on his way in?
Okay
He asked me to pump his show a little bit because he wants people in on this one. It's uh
So basically tonight's show is about sex tape, celebrity sex tapes.
Like, Evan was bragging how he has the full length cut of the Verntroyer tape before the
show.
And he's going to just talk about celebrity sex tapes all night, he's got an interview
with Ray J from the Kim Kardashian celebrity sex tape. He's going to be playing some of
his music. It's got Vern Troyer. He's going to talk to the cameraman from the Vern Troyer
tape tonight. And a lot of other exciting stuff. And he's going to do a call and segment
who do you want to see in a celebrity sex tape is the next topic. And the winner of
that gets to, Evan will give you his car, put an asterisk next to that, then that the
asterisk now goes to the bottom of the page and it says no cars will be given away during
Evan's show.
